# PyBer_Analysis
Analysis for the Pyber Ride-Sharing Company.

Thanks to all the city and fare data. Without such raw data, we would not have arrived at such conclusions regarding this analysis.

## Challenge

Some of the tools used: 
1. Jupyter Notebooks with various dependencies
2. GitCMD and Github

As an upcoming Data Analysist, I wanted to tackle a problem head-on and deliver solutions based on the companyâ€™s needs. I wanted to take this amazing project and paint a new perspective and turn some heads from its conclusions. Analyzing the data was no easy task. First, we had to make sure the raw data was validated and cleaned. Both the summary dataframes and the resulting fares by city type plot reached a conclusion: urban cities tend to higher rate of rides, which decrease the collective fare. On the other hand, rural areas tend to have fewer rides with higher fares due to the low demand and supply in certain rural areas. Suburban data is placed in the middle of these conclusions.

Some challenges were to locate the performance vs readable methods. For the code to work with millions of rows of data, we had to inspect the code with a keen eye for readable and professional code. Using official pandas and matplotlib documentation helped achieve such clean code. Such code comes by hard these days due to the rapid rise of data collection and instant gratification of conclusions.

### Recommendations

By looking at the data, we can see the most activity is in urban/city areas, where more of the traffic, destinations, entertainment, and leisure activities are located. Suburban areas are more coveted in such activities, but that is where is most of the residents live. Rural areas are sparse and almost lifeless in activity, so such disparity in low demand and low supply of ridesharing is surely understandable.

It would certainly be a venture in pursuing a better understanding if one could access timeframe data per ride, such as how long the ride happened, and pickup and drop-off locations. Other factors age group of the people as wells as driver tip data could offer better insights towards other disparities. It would easy access data such as this from a smartphone app, where users can sign-up, with age restrictions of course, and promptly order rides and give driver tip as necessary.
